# Scraper-0.1
An updated version of the scraper malware, and yes it actually runs now, so no need to fix that. added some TTS and subprocessing, let me know what you think of it.
mostly made in python and vbscript, took about an hour to complete the project, i will be updating this every weekend.
this will only run in windows 10  (windows 7 maybe as well) you will also need python 3.9
# WARNING
This is REAL malware and will damage your system, you should only run this in a VM (virtual machine) unless you
just want to demolish your system for some reason, the best virtualization software right now is Virtualbox,
you can download Virtualbox at https://www.virtualbox.com/wiki/downloads
microsoft has a free iso file of windows 10 you can run in virtualbox.
